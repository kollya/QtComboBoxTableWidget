1. You need Visual Studio 2017. I used the community edition version.
2. You need to install the Qt5 SDK. You need to install the 64-bit SDK as the solution is 64-bit.
3. You need to set an environment variable pointing to the Qt5 SDK. The name is QT5_DIR. For example, I set mine to: C:\Tools\Qt5\5.12.1\
4. Open the provided solution and build. It will copy the necesary Qt5 DLL in the output folder so the program can run.
